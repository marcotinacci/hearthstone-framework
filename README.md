# Hearthstone Framework
This project arise from the challenge represented by the elegant design of the popular Blizzard videogame *Hearthstone*. Object oriented programming offers many design patterns that cannot be unseen in the game mechanics. Another target of this work is to implement an easily extendible framework that give the possibility, for instance, to personalize the game with *custom cards*, *custom heroes* or *custom rules*.

## Give birth to new ideas
So many concepts of new cards or new hero classes can be found on the internet, this project is for all the people that want to see their ideas come to life. Once the infrastructure will be ready, all the mechanics employed in the original game like *deathrattle*, *battlecry*, *combo*, *effects on target*, *ongoing effects* and so on. A few lines of code will be enough to create your custom minion or to create a new kind of effect, for instance a one-turn spell power +1. I want to put some effort in providing documentation and tutorials to simplify the use of the framework.

## Java implementation
Java has been chosen for the implementation, because it offers many constructs to build object design patterns and, at the same time, is quite easy to use and to learn.
This is useful because people who wants to contribute must be able to do it, as easy as possible and as fast as possible. Moreover Java is cross-platform, which is nice.
